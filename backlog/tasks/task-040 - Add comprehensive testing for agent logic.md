# Add comprehensive testing for agent logic

## Description
Create comprehensive test suite for all agent functionality including unit tests, integration tests, and agent behavior validation.

## Dependencies

- task-034 - Implement shopping list optimization agent
- task-035 - Implement preference learning agent

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests for all agent components
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- Mock systems for external dependencies
- Performance testing for agent workflows
- Behavior validation tests
- Test coverage metrics tracking

## Implementation Plan
1. Design agent testing strategy
2. Implement unit tests for each agent
