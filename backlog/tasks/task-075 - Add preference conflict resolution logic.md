# Add preference conflict resolution logic

## Description
Implement intelligent conflict resolution system for handling contradictory or competing user preferences.

## Dependencies
- task-074 - Implement preference inference from user actions
- task-073 - Create pgvector integration for similarity search

## Acceptance Criteria
- Conflict detection algorithms implemented
- Resolution strategies defined and working
- Priority-based preference handling
- User feedback integration for conflicts
- Transparent conflict resolution reporting
- Fallback mechanisms for unresolvable conflicts

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement conflict detection algorithms
2. Create resolution strategy framework
3. Build priority-based handling system
4. Add user feedback integration
5. Implement transparent reporting
6. Create fallback mechanisms
