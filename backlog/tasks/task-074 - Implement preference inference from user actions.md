# Implement preference inference from user actions

## Description
Create intelligent system to infer user preferences from their actions, choices, and behavior patterns within the application.

## Dependencies
- task-071 - Implement structured preference storage in Firestore
- task-035 - Implement preference learning agent

## Acceptance Criteria
- User action tracking implemented
- Preference inference algorithms working
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Confidence scoring for inferences
- Feedback loop integration
- Privacy-compliant data handling

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement user action tracking
2. Create preference inference algorithms
3. Build behavioral pattern recognition
4. Add confidence scoring system
5. Integrate feedback loops
6. Ensure privacy compliance
