# Implement substitution suggestion logic

## Description
Create intelligent ingredient substitution system that suggests alternatives based on availability, preferences, and dietary restrictions.

## Dependencies
- task-031 - Set up Agno agent project structure
- task-036 - Create semantic memory integration with pgvector

## Acceptance Criteria
- Ingredient substitution engine implemented
- Alternative ingredient database created
- Nutritional and flavor compatibility logic
- Dietary restriction consideration
- Confidence scoring for suggestions
- Integration with recipe processing

## Implementation Plan
1. Design substitution logic architecture
2. Create ingredient alternative database
3. Implement compatibility algorithms
4. Add dietary restriction handling
5. Build confidence scoring system
6. Integrate with recipe processing
