# Implement preference learning agent

## Description
Create an intelligent agent that learns and tracks user preferences based on their interactions, choices, and feedback.

## Dependencies
- task-031 - Set up Agno agent project structure
- task-032 - Design agent orchestration architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- Preference learning agent implemented
- User behavior tracking and analysis
- Preference inference algorithms
- Feedback processing system
- Preference conflict resolution
- Integration with semantic memory

## Implementation Plan
1. Design preference learning architecture
2. Implement user behavior tracking
3. Create preference inference algorithms
4. Build feedback processing system
5. Add conflict resolution logic
6. Integrate with semantic memory system
