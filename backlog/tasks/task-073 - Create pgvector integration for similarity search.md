# Create pgvector integration for similarity search

## Description
Implement pgvector integration for efficient similarity search of preferences and recommendations based on embeddings.

## Dependencies
- task-007 - Configure Cloud SQL Postgres with pgvector
- task-072 - Set up embedding generation for semantic preferences

## Acceptance Criteria
- pgvector integration implemented
- Similarity search functionality working
- Performance optimized queries
- Indexing for vector operations
- Integration with preference system
- Recommendation generation based on similarity

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement pgvector database integration
2. Create similarity search functions
3. Optimize queries and indexing
4. Build vector operation interfaces
5. Integrate with preference system
6. Implement recommendation generation
