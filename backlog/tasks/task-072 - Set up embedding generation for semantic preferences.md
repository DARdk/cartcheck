# Set up embedding generation for semantic preferences

## Description
Implement embedding generation system for converting user preferences into vector representations for semantic similarity.

## Dependencies
- task-070 - Design preference taxonomy and classification
- task-007 - Configure Cloud SQL Postgres with pgvector

## Acceptance Criteria
- Embedding generation pipeline implemented
- Preference text vectorization working
- Integration with embedding models
- Batch processing capabilities
- Performance optimization for embeddings
- Integration with pgvector storage

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up embedding generation pipeline
2. Implement preference text processing
3. Integrate with embedding models
4. Add batch processing capabilities
5. Optimize performance and caching
6. Integrate with pgvector storage
