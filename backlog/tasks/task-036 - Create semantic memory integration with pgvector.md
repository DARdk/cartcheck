# Create semantic memory integration with pgvector

## Description
Implement semantic memory system using pgvector for storing and retrieving contextual information and preferences.

## Dependencies
- task-007 - Configure Cloud SQL Postgres with pgvector
- task-031 - Set up Agno agent project structure

## Acceptance Criteria
- Semantic memory system implemented
- pgvector integration working
- Embedding generation and storage
- Similarity search functionality
- Memory retrieval and ranking
- Integration with agent framework

## Implementation Plan
1. Design semantic memory architecture
2. Implement embedding generation system
3. Create pgvector storage integration
4. Build similarity search functionality
5. Add memory retrieval and ranking
6. Integrate with agent framework
