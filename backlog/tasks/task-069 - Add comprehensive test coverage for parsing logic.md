# Add comprehensive test coverage for parsing logic

## Description
Create comprehensive test suite for all recipe parsing functionality including unit tests, integration tests, and edge case testing.

## Dependencies
- task-063 - Implement JSON-LD recipe parsing schema.org
- task-064 - Add fallback HTML parsing for non-structured recipes
- task-068 - Create recipe validation and quality checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests for all parsing components
- Integration tests with real recipe websites
- Edge case testing and handling
- Performance testing for parsing speed
- Mock data generation for testing
- Test coverage metrics tracking

## Implementation Plan
1. Create unit tests for parsing components
2. Build integration tests with real sites
3. Implement edge case testing
4. Add performance testing suite
5. Create mock data generation
6. Set up coverage metrics tracking
