# Implement recipe image handling and storage

## Description
Implement system for extracting, processing, and storing recipe images from various sources with optimization and CDN integration.

## Dependencies
- task-063 - Implement JSON-LD recipe parsing schema.org
- task-064 - Add fallback HTML parsing for non-structured recipes

## Acceptance Criteria
- Recipe image extraction from various sources
- Image optimization and compression
- Multiple format support (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- CDN integration for image delivery
- Image metadata extraction
- Storage cost optimization

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement image extraction from recipes
2. Create image optimization pipeline
3. Add multiple format support
4. Integrate with CDN for delivery
5. Extract and store image metadata
6. Optimize storage costs and performance
